The purpose of this, is to test Golang cuncurrency, by printing 1 million integers.

There will be a simple program, that just prints 1 million integers in a simple for-loop and 9 other programs
that will print 1 million integers with the use of Go's concurrency.

The result, which will be measured by how long it it took for the integers to be printed to complete in 
seconds, will be added to a text file. There will be at least 10 results for each program.

All of the results were done on my Asus Rog Zephyrus G14, with the specs:
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS with Radeon Graphics, 3000 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s).
RAM: 16GB.
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti.
Disk drive is just a Harddisk.

I dont know what other information would be relevant.
